 From within command line, i am able to CRUD via command line.
 python3 manage.py shell

 create data
 >>> from django.utils import timezone
 >>> q = Question(question_text="What's new?", pub_date=timezone.now())

 save data
 # Save the object into the database. You have to call save() explicitly.
 >>> q.save()

 check data values
 # Now it has an ID.
 >>> q.id
 1


 # Access model field values via Python attributes.
 >>> q.question_text
 "What's new?"

 edited values must be saved again
 Change values by changing the attributes, then calling save().
 >>> q.question_text = "What's up?"
 >>> q.save()
